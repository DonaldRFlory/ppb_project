Notes on Pyro firing system using ESP32 controlled by web page.

NCV8402 drivers have gate threshold of 2.2V max so can work with 3.3V supply
for shift registers.

---I/Os for power board--------
SRClr
SPI Clk == SHRClk
SPI MISO  == output from shift register chain
SPI MOSI  == input to shift register chain
/SRXfer   == /STRClk
SRClr   -- clear sr's, goes through fail-safe one-shot
Keep Alive


Shift register holding and output registers are both reset if fail-safe
times out.

-------Arduino Setup-----------
Seems I already have the preferences setting in Arduino IDE for ESP32.
Tried first sketch, the wifi scan and it compiled, loaded, and ran.
I have LED's connected to GPIO27 and GPIO28.
Moved one LED to GPIO23, ran blink test program, it blinks.
Moving right along...
Connected LEDs back to GPIO27 and GPIO28.
Preparing to run Unit 2 - Web Server.
Modified HTML code to make buttons and text smaller, added more buttons,
actually copies of the two original ones for a total of ten buttons
down middle of web page. Do not yet know how to arrange in an array, with
more than one per line.

So am planning to use VSPI with default pins and for starters using SS.
This works perfectly!

So pins for power board 48-------------
1  12 V
2  12 V
3  Gnd
4  Gnd
5  5V
6  3.3V unused
7  Gnd
8  MISO
9  SPI CLK
10 MOSI
11 N.C.
12 N.C
13 PWM0  ground it
14 SRClr ground it
15 /SRXFR   use it
16 DrvSense (will be +12 V sense)   ADC0 (GPIO36)
17 TestSenseB                       ADC3 (GPIO39)
 18 TestSenseA                       ADC6 (GPIO34)
20 KeepAlive (connect to SPI CLK)

Connections to ESP32----------
3 analog
CLK, MOSI, MISO, /XFR

from baseboard to ESP32----
 +5V, Gnd
