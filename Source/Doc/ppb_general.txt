So upon getting back to appb_project after working with ESP32 firing system for
a while, decided to document some of the various functions and capabilities
since I have done a pile of things on the Arduino platform.

PING-PONG BALL CANNON:------------------------------------------------------
Looking at ping-pong ball cannons, I see I have cannibalized the Electronic
Speed Controls which provide 5 Volts for the Arduino and hand-wired adaptor
boards via BE (battery eliminator) on ESC's. Not even clear to me which
version of appb_project is used. Clearly I use a switch input to trigger
the whole thing.  The power is from 3S LIPO providing about 12 volts.
This is used for solenoid drive in single ball mode.
It looks like code for this is under Source\ppb .

ppb_step versions are for running steppers for x-y table and tube
winding fixture. Also for ramping tests with long track.



GENERAL PLATFORM ADAPTOR BOARD------------------------
AUX-----
provides five Aux digital I/O  bits used for fire-switch
input and 4 solenoid outputs.

PWM/Step
D6-D12 provide either six PWM outputs for controlling hobby servos
or 6 control lines for 2 stepper drivers wtih ENA, DIR and STEP.

Looks like another version with just STEP and DIR outputs allowing
four steppers to be controlled.


SENSOR/ANALOG
A0-A7 pins used for four sensors and four limit switch inputs.

Using two pots on the copper tube winding fixture.

Also had fixture for circular motion (coffee stirrer plate).


When using Arduino for stepper drive, I used LM2596 buck regulator
module to provide 5 Volts. This is provided for on my PC layout of
adaptor board.(or at least fits in the prototyping area)
