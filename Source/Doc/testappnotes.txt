FireButton calls StartFireSequence() which is in Servo.cs .  This sets
 Firing bool to true and FireTimer to zero. FireTimer counts calls to FireServe() function.

This is called in timer1_Tick() which is called every 10 milliseconds.

Servos each have a slider with spin-boxes on each end to set limits.
Each servo has spin boxes to control Up and Down increments during cycling.
Also dwell at each end of motion.
Service routines for each servo have a bunch of states. The timing values for Delay
and Dwell are in milliseconds though applied in 10 ms steps so precision is 10 ms.
Step values are in microseconds of servo PWM setting.

FireServe() is only called (in timeserve) if SensorUpdate checkbox is checked.
Actually we return from timer1_Tick() 4 times out of 5 before getting to FireServe or UpdateSensors.
and also before CycleS0Serve().
CycleS0Serve() cycles S0 between P1 and P3 values.
SensorUpdate also controls updating sensors (periodic communication with Arduino)
UpdateSensors() function uses DataUpdate() link call which transfers values down for 4 servos
and values up for 4 sensors in one link transaction. Then it updates trackbars to show
A/D of sensors values.
