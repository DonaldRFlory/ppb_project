Hi, donald. Lines without a recognized macro like MBEGIN, MITEM, MITEM, or MEND int
the first recognized word are ignored by the menu setup function. Space is not a separator
for tokenizing. We only use comma and left and right paretheses and tab and single quote and double quote
as delimiters.

MBEGIN(MainMenu, Menu 1)
FITEM('1', Read servo 0 USec, GetServoUsec, RTNVAL, 0, "", "", "")
FITEM('2', Move servo 0 to 2200, SetServoUsec, 0, 0, 2200,  "", "")
FITEM('3', Move servo 0 to 800, SetServoUsec, 0, 0, 800, "", "")
FITEM('4', Move servo 1 to 2200, SetServoUsec, 0, 1, 2200,  "", "")
FITEM('5', Move servo 1 to 800, SetServoUsec, 0, 1, 800, "", "")
FITEM('r', Read servo USec, GetServoUsec, RTNVAL, Servo Index:, "", "", "")
FITEM('w', Set servo USec , SetServoUsec, 0, Servo Index:, USec:, "", "")
MEND
